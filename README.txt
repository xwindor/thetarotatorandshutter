This code is used with an Arduino UNO, Ricoh Theta S, Sparkfun ESP8266 wifi stackable module, and a stepper motor.

First the Arduino connects to the Ricoh Theta S. It then takes a picture with the Ricoh Theta S.
The motor then rotates the camera 90 degrees again and takes a picture once it finishes rotating.
